Awful awful minecraft mod I made as a bit that has a ton of bugs 
and is poorly written since I have never written in Java before and did not read anything about it even now!
It is quite funny though... It should generally work if u dont have any mods related to GUI or HUD installed...
It also will display missing textures in the end and nether as I havent added any.
It will also crash if you go between biomes too quickly!
